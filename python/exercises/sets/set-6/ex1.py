'''
1. Write a function to take a list. Filter all the prime numbers, add to new list and return the new list.
    Example :
        org_list=[10,20,30,40,50,60,100,11]
        result=func_exec(org_list)
        print(result)
        Expected Output : [11]
    Example :
        org_list=[10,20,23,30,40,50,60,100,11]
        result=func_exec(org_list)
        print(result)
        Expected Output : [11,23]
        :param org_list: Original list passed by the User
        :return: New list with filtered values ONLY.        
Solution Steps:
**************
Iterate the the original list
From the list Checking for number is greater than Or equals to 2 
    Checking the co-factors of list (range 2 to original list)
        If number has co_factors :
            loop will break
        else:
            Add to new list    
            loop not breakable the number is prime
Finally return the new list

            # if we found any co-factors between these range this is a prime number        
            for j in range(2,i):

# Execution
testorg_list=[10,20,30,40,50,60,100,11]
#function calling
result=check_prime(org_list=testorg_list)
#finally print result
print("Final Result is :: {} ".format(result))
