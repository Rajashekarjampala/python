# Find if a number is prime or not
def find_prime(numX):
  '''
    Aim : Check if numX is prime or not
    :params:
    --------
    :param numX: An integer number
    :return:
    --------
    True if number is prime
    False if number is not prime
    :exception:
    -----------
    If numX is non-integer raise an exception
    :solution:
    ----------
  
      Example: 
      --------
      Assume numX=11
        - Any number is divisble by 1.
        - Any number is divisible by itself.
      
      Check if 11 is divisible by any number from 2 to 11
      If it's Zero, then it's not a prime.
      
      11/2 !=0
      11/3 !=0
      11/4 !=0
      11/5 !=0
      11/6 !=0
      11/7 !=0
      11/8 !=0
      11/9 !=0
      11/10 !=0
          
      Write a loop to check if numX is prime.
      
      1. From number 2 till numX, iterate and divide the 
      number by numX .
      
      2. If numX is divisible by another number, if   
      remainder is 0, return False -> Its not PRIME
      
      3. If numX is not divisible by any number, 
      if remainder > 0, return True -> Its PRIME

'''
* Function 1:
* Define function as find prime 
* Take parameter as numX and it must type is int only
* Iterate the range like range as (2,numX), (2,numX is stored in numbers)
* 1 is divisible by any number and numX divisible by numX Thats why I took range as (2,numX)
* Check the numX is divisible by number (between 1,11)
* The Divisible out put is stored in divReminder (Store reminder)
* If Reminder is 0 Its not a prime number then return False
* Else getting any reminder Its prime number then return True 

* Function 2:
* Define function as prime_array(list)
* Define the new array
* Iterate the array and stored in variable as number
* Stored the prime number in variable as isPrime 
* If isPrime is True add to newArray
* Then return the newArray
